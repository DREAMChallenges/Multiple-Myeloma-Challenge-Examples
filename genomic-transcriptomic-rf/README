## Example model for dockerizing

## This directory contains some supporting files that need _not_ be included in the docker instance.  These are:
README
output/
output/predictions.tsv
training-sessionInfo.txt
test-sessionInfo.txt
create-model-metadata.R
training-data/
training-data/train-annotation-data.tsv
training-data/train-expression-data.tsv
training-data/train-genomic-data.tsv

## Create metadata state for classifier.
Rscript ./create-model-metadata.R --metadata-dir=metadata --training-dir=training-data --test-dir=test-data
## The contestant would do the above during the training phase and would just include the metadata
## directory populated by this script in their docker instance.

## Run the classifer.
## These are the only commands that would be included in the docker instance.
## BEGIN RUN CLASSIFIER
./score_sc1.sh
## END RUN CLASSIFIER

## The above creates an output file ${output_dir}/predictions.tsv
## The output should have the following format (tsv file with named columns):
## ID: sample name
## raw.score:  a numeric score with higher score corresponding to high-risk samples
## high.risk:  TRUE or FALSE, indicating whether sample is called high risk by the model
